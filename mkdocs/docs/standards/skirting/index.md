The Club will provide cloth skirting for each show. Special attention needs to be given when removing the skirting from the tables.

- Carefully pull the edge of the skirting back from the edge and slowly pull the skirting back over itself to remove from table.
- **DO NOT** pull the skirting off at a 90 degree angle from the table. This will put an enormous amount of stress on the glue/screws/staples and cause us to continue to have to reattach the Velcro to the batons.
- Fold the skirting and return it to the correct tote when done.
