The Club will supply enough Plexiglas for the entire layout:

- Each Plexiglas piece should be no more than 1/8” thick and measure 10 5/8” x 10”, 10 5/8” x 20”. 10 5/8” x 30”, or 10 5/8” x 40”. This is then slid into the routed slot in the baton on the front of the table.
- Once inserted, the Plexiglas should be no more than 9 1/2” from top of the module table to the top of the Plexiglas.
- Custom sized pieces may be used on the layout, but can be no more than an 1/8” thick. All custom sized pieces are the responsibility of the individual Club member to buy and transport.
