**Club Standards**

Being that our club does not have a permanent layout, we consider ourselves to be a modular club, meaning that we can adjust to most room sizes. Before a show, a call goes out to all club members as to the amount of content they will be bringing to the show and how much table space is needed. The club has basically three sizes of tables: 30” x 40”, 40” x 40”, and 40” x 60” – all table top dimensions. The show coordinator will then formulate a layout plan based on space constraints of the venue and member content dimensions. In order to do this, we have to have some standards so that when all the tables come together at a show, everything lines up and fits together with little, or no problems.
