This is a BrickWorld Chicago 2017 talk by Jim Pirzyk on the where, what, why, and how of running power through a LEGO city layout using brick built roads. The goal is a road module that does double duty: it looks like normal street infrastructure, but it also acts as a reliable power bus for lighting and other layout accessories. The talk walks through the design goals, the parts and tools needed, and a practical build method for wiring harnesses, connectors, and lamp post sockets so setup is quick, polarity is clear, and modules connect cleanly during a show.

## Design goals

- Quick setup
- Low resistance and scalable
- Flexible design
- Simplicity
- Resilient
- Reversible

## Tools

- Wire strippers
- Crimp tool and extraction tool for 0.062 in pins
- Wire cutters
- Needle nose pliers (bent nose helps)
- Soldering iron
- Variable speed drill with a sharp 1/8 in bit
- Phillips bit
- Tack hammer
- Utility knife and X-acto razor saw
- Multimeter (optional) 

## Supplies

- 22 AWG solid wire (red and black)
- Molex terminals and receptacles (0.062 in, male and female)
- 40 pin header strip (0.1 in center)
- 10 pin stackable header (for sockets)
- Craft glue, Sharpie (red and black), coarse sandpaper
- Optional: connector coating
- Solder, steel wool
- Brickstuff DIY connecting cables
- Optional: LEDs and power pack or adapters

## Build overview

### Street lights and sockets

- Break off 2 pins from the header strip and trim. Do not strip too much wire. Do not overheat the pins. Mark the exposed pin red. Glue pins to the lamppost and mark the underside to match. Let glue fully cure. 
- Cut 2 pin sockets from the 10 pin header strip using a razor saw. Bend the leads and hook the ends.

### Wiring harness

- Cut wires: 31 studs long (one red, one black), plus two short reds (3 studs) and two short blacks (2 studs).
- Strip the 31 stud wires with three middle strips (about 1/8 in long), starting at the lamppost socket area, then strip the ends. Strip the short wires and hook one end of each. 
- Crimp terminals: six female terminals (left ends of the long wires and the straight ends of the short wires) and two male terminals (right ends of the long wires). 
- Solder each connector after crimping to the insulation. After cooling, crimp again and test continuity (multimeter helps).
- Assemble the harness by soldering the short wires onto the long wires and soldering the lamppost socket leads into place. 

### Road assembly

- Make sockets: trim tabs for female sockets, sand and trim as needed for male sockets, and color code.
- Push terminals into sockets, build the road onto the baseplate, add sidewalks, trees, and lamppost, then test again.

## Common issues and future changes

Known issues include terminal connectors walking, broken wires, and pins sliding in the lamppost.

Possible future changes include a different lamppost socket, new road segments (including 16 x 32 half roads), grade crossings, curves, more internal connections, traffic lights, crossbucks, and flickering lampposts.
