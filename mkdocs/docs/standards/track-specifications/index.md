The following specifications are based on the assumption that the track is running at the front of the club table.

- Club members are responsible for supplying the track for the two main lines running across their Club tables.
- The first track is located on studs five through twelve from the front edge of the club table/base plate.  There are to be four studs from the track to the edge of the club table/base plate.
- The second track is located on studs twenty-one through twenty-eight from the front edge of the club table/base plate.  There are to be four studs from the track to the back edge of the club table/base plate, and a gap of eight studs between both tracks.
- Track ballasting (colors, details) are up to each individual Club member but there are to be two plates between the track and the base plate.
  - The [**PennLUG/L-gauge.org**](http://l-gauge.org/wiki/index.php?title=Reference_Instructions#Track_Components) standards are a great resource guide.
  - If a club member chooses not to utilize the ballasting standard, then it is the responsibility of that member to make sure their track layout will line up with their neighbors.
- Track and ballast measure 12 studs wide when using the PennLUG standard on a straight section of track. Track and ballast should still measure 12 studs when in a curve as well.  To check for clearance, center a 1×12 brick over the track (6 studs on the left, 6 studs on the right), then proceed to slide the brick along the curved track while keeping the brick centered.
- Structures around, or over the tracks must conform to track clearances as specified above, as well as a minimum of 18 bricks from the top of the of the track.
- At any point where there is an event (curve/switch/bridge) there is to be a 5” length of straight track between the event and the next event. (Example: A switch track, then a 5” length of straight track, then another switch track.)  The **exception** would be an S-Curve. With an S-Curve, there shall be a 20” length of straight track before the next event.
- Special attention must be paid to arched openings. No part of an arch opening should extend into the specifications stated above.

**Double Straight Standard:**

**R120 / R104 Curve Standard:**

NILTC corners shall ideally use R120 curves (outer) and R104 curves (inner) supplied from any vendor. The R120 and R104 curves currently take up a 40″ square table space.  Minimum mainline curves are R104.
