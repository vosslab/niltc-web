Annual dues are currently:

## Prospective Members

If you are interested in joining NILTC, please send an e-mail to: niltc.contact@gmail.com and include the following:

- Name
- Age
- Where you live
- What you like to build

We will invite you to our next meeting to get to know you a little bit, check out a build or two of yours, and we’ll go from there.
