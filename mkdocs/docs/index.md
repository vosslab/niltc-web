## What you will see at a show

NILTC displays a connected brick-built train layout with towns, streets, structures, and small details that reward close looking. Shows are family friendly, free to browse, and a great place to ask questions about building techniques, trains, and layout design.

NILTC membership is for adults (18+). NILTC welcomes builders who enjoy trains and builders who simply want to collaborate, learn, and display with a friendly group.
